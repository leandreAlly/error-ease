## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/error-ease) to install error-ease.

```bash
npm i error-ease
```

## Usage

1.  First, import the errorHandler at the top of your app.ts or app.js file:

```javascript
import { errorHandler } from 'error-ease';
```

2. After defining your routes, use the **errorHandler** as middleware:

```javascript
app.use(errorHandler);
```

Here's an example of how your **app.ts** or **app.js** file might look:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { errorHandler } from 'error-ease';

const app = express();

// Define your routes here...

// Use the errorHandler middleware
app.use(errorHandler);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

3. Using `asyncWrapper` for Error Handling:
   _The asyncWrapper is a utility function that simplifies error handling in Express routes. It wraps your route handlers and automatically catches any errors that occur, passing them to the next middleware._

- When to Use asyncWrapper:

  - Inline Route Handlers:
    If you're defining your route handlers inline, like this:
    ```javascript
    route.get('/', async (req, res) => {
      // statements
    });
    ```
    _You don't need to use asyncWrapper, unless you want to avoid adding a try-catch block. The asyncWrapper will automatically catch any errors that occur in your route handler and pass them to the next middleware._
  - Separated Route Handlers:
    If you're separating your route handlers from your route definitions, like this:

    ```javascript
    const login = async (req, res) => {
      // statement
    };

    route.get('/', login);
    ```

    You should use asyncWrapper to ensure that errors are properly caught and handled. Here's how you can use asyncWrapper in this case:

    ```javascript
    import { asyncWrapper } from 'error-ease';

    const login = asyncWrapper(async (req, res) => {
      // statements
    });

    route.get('/', login);
    ```

    With `asyncWrapper`, your code will be safe and any errors that occur in your route handler will be automatically caught and passed to the next middleware, without the need for a try-catch

4. **Error ease in Action**:

- **Throwing Errors with `BadRequestError`**: _this class is a custom error class that you can use to throw HTTP 400 Bad Request errors in your application. Here's how you can use it:_

  ```javascript
  import { BadRequestError } from 'error-ease';

  route.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
    const { email, password } = req.body;

    if (!email || !password) {
      throw new BadRequestError('Email and password are required');
    }

    // Continue with your login logic...
  });
  ```

- **Throwing Errors with `ConflictRequestError`**:
  _this class is a custom error class that you can use to throw HTTP 409 Conflict errors in your application. Here's how you can use it:_

  ```javascript
  import { ConflictRequestError } from 'error-ease';

  route.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
    const { email } = req.body;

    const userExists = await User.findOne({ email });

    if (userExists) {
      throw new ConflictRequestError('User with this email already exists');
    }

    // Continue with your registration logic...
  });
  ```

- **Throwing Errors with `DatabaseConnectionError`**:
  _this class is a custom error class that you can use to throw errors when there's an issue connecting to your database. Here's how you can use it:_

  ```javascript
  import mongoose from 'mongoose';
  import { DatabaseConnectionError } from 'error-ease';

  async function connectToDb() {
    try {
      await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp');
    } catch (err) {
      throw new DatabaseConnectionError();
    }
  }
  ```

- **Throwing Errors with `NotAuthorizedError`**:
  _this class is a custom error class that you can use to throw HTTP 401 Unauthorized errors in your application. Here's how you can use it:_

  ```javascript
  import { NotAuthorizedError } from 'error-ease';

  route.get('/protected', async (req, res) => {
    if (!req.user) {
      throw new NotAuthorizedError('You must be logged in to access this route');
    }

    // Continue with your route handler...
  });
  ```

- **Throwing Errors with `NotFoundError`**:
  _this class is a custom error class that you can use to throw HTTP 404 Not Found errors in your application. Here's how you can use it:_

  ```javascript
  import { NotFoundError } from 'error-ease';

  route.get('/user/:id', async (req, res) => {
    const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);

    if (!user) {
      throw new NotFoundError('User not found');
    }

    // Continue with your route handler...
  });
  ```

  **Note:** The error message ('User not found' in this example) is optional. If you don't provide a message, a default message will be used.
